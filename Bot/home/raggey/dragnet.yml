# Before you begin, you should copy and rename this file, as it's an example file that won't be used by the server.
# You can do this by running the following command:
#
#     cp dragnet-example.yml dragnet.yml
#
# Once copied, edit the dragnet.yml file.

# Replace This with the discord webhook for your channel

# This is the list of Servers. I've filled out blocks for the three jabbers you want (replace them with actual
# credentials / addresses). You can add more by simple copy pasting one of the blocks below, make sure to keep the
# indentation the same.
servers:
  - address: goonfleet.com
    alias: Goon Jabber
    username: durka_mcdurka
    password: Durka2323

# This block customises what happens when shit goes sideways and jabber server connections fail
reconnectionStrategy:
  # How much the time between retries is incremented. By default this is set to 20. This means that if a connection
  # fails, we will retry after 20 seconds, then 40, then 60 etc...
  increment: 20
  # This customises how often there will be a ping notifying you that something is wrong with one of the server
  # connections. At the first failure, and every n-failures afterwards, you'll be pinged with an error in the same
  # channel.
  pingIncrement: 5
